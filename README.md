# Graph Foundation Models for Recommendation: A Comprehensive Survey

This repository contains all materials for my short story assignment on Graph Foundation Models for Recommendation Systems, based on the survey paper by Wu et al. (2025).

## Author
**Name:** Yugm Maneshkumar Patel

## Overview
This assignment explores the emerging field of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for recommendation systems. GFMs represent a significant advancement in recommendation technology by integrating the strengths of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

The survey examines how GFMs effectively utilize both structural information and textual data to create more precise and personalized recommendations. The taxonomy presented covers three main approaches: Graph-Augmented LLM, LLM-Augmented Graph, and LLM-Graph Harmonization, along with key challenges and future directions.
